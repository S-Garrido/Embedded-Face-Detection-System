# Embedded-Face-Detection-System

This is a Embedded Face Detection System that I and three other classmates developed for our ENEE408M class in the Spring 20222 semseter. Included is our report (EFDS-Report.PDF) which goes into detail of the functionality of the system, and how we implemented the system.
